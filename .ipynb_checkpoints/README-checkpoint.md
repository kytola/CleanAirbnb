# Work with Inside Airbnb data
Code to download, clean and visualize Inside Airbnb data.

Relevant Jupyter Notebooks are broken up into three distinct folders. Each of these folders contains 
one or more Jupyter Notebook to complete tasks related to the folder name.

	1. Download and compile data: Files are downloaded from http://insideairbnb.com/ and 
		stored on user's personal computer. This folder includes code for organizing directories.
	2. Clean data: Notebooks in this folder perform preliminary data cleaning for future analysis.
	3. Graphic: Notebooks create visualizations about the Inside Airbnb datasets.

Specific folders contain further information about the focus of Jupyter Notebooks.
